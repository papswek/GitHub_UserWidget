As someone who is new to Angular, Visual Studio, and API Gateway, I understand that there is a learning curve to overcome before diving into implementation. It's important to take the time to study and familiarize yourself with these technologies to ensure a successful project.

To speed up implementation, it may be helpful to focus on learning the specific aspects of these technologies that will be needed for the project. This could involve targeted tutorials or courses, and practicing with sample projects.

I can empathize with the challenges of balancing work and learning new technologies. One approach to managing time is to break down the learning process into manageable chunks, and consistently dedicating a set amount of time each day or week to study and practice.

Finally, I understand that not knowing the programming languages required for the project can be overwhelming. In such cases, it may be beneficial to seek out guidance from more experienced developers or online communities. Additionally, exploring online resources such as documentation and forums can help build a foundational understanding of the programming languages used in the project.

One struggle that I am currently facing during development is the challenge of publishing my API gateway to a cloud service. As someone who is new to this process, I'm finding it difficult to navigate the various steps required to successfully deploy the API.

One issue that I've encountered is the need for a subscription to the cloud service. Since I am not familiar with this requirement, I've found it challenging to figure out how to acquire the necessary subscription and what the associated costs may be.
